# Red Black Trees

Created on October 6, 2020

Implementation of a red-black tree.

A red-black tree is a binary search tree that is balanced using the following properties:

1. All nodes have either red or black assoociated with them.
2. The root node is black.
3. The children of a red node are black.
4. For each node with at least one null child, the number of black nodes from the root to the null child is the same.

Lookup, insertion, and deletion have a worst-case time complexity of O(log N).
